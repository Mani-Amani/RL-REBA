# Unity Ergonomic Optimization Scripts

This repository contains a selection of C# scripts designed for ergonomic optimization inside the Unity game engine. These scripts aim to optimize for the most ideal object handover location for human robot interaction given ergonomic scores such as REBA utilizing reinforcement learning. The goal is to extend this optimization from a virtual environemnt to real life coordinates in order to guide robot decision making for the most safe human-robot collaboration.
## Overview
This repo contains the RL regiment, REBA calculation using joint models and a selection of the Inverse Kinematic controlers.
The opitimization is performed on a humanoid 3D model:

## Video Demonstration

To give you a better understanding of the scripts' functionality and their impact on ergonomic optimization, we have prepared a video demonstration. This video showcases the inner workings and the practical application of the scripts in a Unity project.
